2648930,152168,0,Is there a performance hit to binding a relative source vs a direct object?,"<p>I'm currently working on my first WPF application, and I'm curious as to whether I'll hit a snag down the line with performance by doing something like this:</p>

 binding.Source = Object

 <pre><code>Dim binding As New Binding(""Value"")
 binding.Source = Object.PropertyOnObject.Property1.Property2

 <p>My objects are fairly dynamic, in that PropertyOnObject can change(and thus changing Property1 and Property2), so it makes sense to do it the first way. Is there a performance penalty for that, though?</p>"

2649250,318032,8,How do Ruby and Python implement their interactive consoles?,"<p>When implementing the interpreter for my programming language I first thought of a simple console window which allows the user to enter some code which is then executed as a standalone program as a shell.</p>
 
 <p>But there are severe problems: If every line of code the user enters is handled as a standalone program, it has to go through the tokenizer and parser and is then just executed by the interpreter - what about functions then? </p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>How can the Python/Ruby interactive consoles (IDLE, irb) ""share"" the code? How is the code entered handled?</li>

 <p>Example:</p>
 
 <pre><code>&gt;&gt; def x:
 &gt;&gt; print(""Blah"")
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; x()

 <p>If I comment out the <code>ModifyStyle()</code> calls, everything works fine, with the obvious proviso that the window style stays normal, so there's a standard window title bar across the top of the screen that I want to get rid of. If I keep the <code>ModifyStyle()</code> calls and comment out the <code>SetWindowPos()</code> calls, the title bar and everything else disappears, but the window has a black region along the top of the screen that is the exact height of the title barâ€”as though it is being reserved. If I don't comment out either of the pairs of calls, as shown in the code above, the screen flickers violently. I believe it's flickering back and forth between the black region being present and not being present, but it's difficult to tell. This flickering also appears to corrupt video memory, as I get persistent artifacts in window title bars (in different applications, no less) and, once, the login picture in the Start menu was replaced with one of my OpenGL textures.</p>

The file containing these details will be written on a yearly basis simply for reporting purposes, but the program will need to be able to access these details quickly.</p>
 
 <p>The way I aim to access these files is to have a program that asks the user for the name of the unique email of the member of staff and for the program to then return the name and the role from that line of the file. I've played around with text files, but am struggling with how I would handle multiple columns of data when it comes to searching this large file. </p>
 
 <p>What is the best format to store such data in? A text file? XML? The size doesn't bother me, but I'd like to be able to search it as quickly as possible. The file will need to contain a lot of entries, probably over the 10K mark over time.</p>

2650040,176645,1,WCF: SecurityNegotiationException when using client,"<p>So I've been trying to set up certificate authentication for my clients and services. The eventual goal is to partition data based on the certificate a client connects with (i.e. the certificate becomes their credentials in to the greater system and their data is partitioned based on these credentials).</p>
 
 <p>I have been able to set it up successfully on both the client and the server side. I have created a certificate and a private key, installed them on my computer, and set up my server such that 1) it has a certificate-based service credential and 2) if a client connects <em>without</em> providing a certificate-based credential an exception is thrown.</p>
 
 <p>What I then did was create a simple client and add a certificate credential to the configuration and try to call a simple operation on the service. </p>
 
 <p>It looks like the client connects OK, and it looks like the certificate is accepted by the server, but I do get this:</p>

2650990,97651,3,Record/Playback with AudioQueue on iPhone,"<p>I am currently using Audio Queues on the iPhone to record and playback audio.</p>
 
 <p>What I would like to be able to do is to record some audio, allow the user to pause the record queue, and to seek back and forward through the audio to select a position from where they can start recording from again.</p>
 
 <p>I have got over the seeking issue by making the playback AudioQueueBuffer sizes small enough so that the play audio queue callback happens at a rate that allows the user to use a slider control to hear the audio as they adjust the slider back and forth.</p>
 
 <p>I think I can achieve the recording at a new position by setting the inStartingPacket parameter of the AudioFileWritePackets function that I call from the Audio Recording Queue callback.</p>
 
 <p>The trouble is this only inserts audio over the previously recorded audio. The file length obviously doesn't change so if the user were to go backwards and record less audio than before, the old audio still remains after the end of the newly recorded audio.</p>
 
 <p>Is there a way I can get the AudioFile to truncate at the point the user starts to insert the new audio, is there some other way I can remove the old audio starting at the insert position or is there a better way about going about this task?</p>

2651170,279259,6,Immutable classes in C++,"<p>In one of my projects, I have some classes that represent entities that cannot change once created, aka. immutable classes.</p>
 
 <p>Example : A class <code>RSAKey</code> that represent a RSA key which only has const methods. There is no point changing the existing instance: if you need another one, you just create one.</p>
 
 <p>My objects sometimes are heavy and I enforced the use of smart pointers to avoid <strong>deep</strong> copy.</p>
 
 <p>So far, I have the following pattern for my classes:</p>
 
 <pre><code>class RSAKey : public boost::noncopyable, public boost::enable_shared_from_this&lt;RSAKey&gt;
 {
  public:
 
  /**
  * \brief Some factory.
  * \param member A member value.
  * \return An instance.
  */
  static boost::shared_ptr&lt;const RSAKey&gt; createFromMember(int member);
 
  /**
  * \brief Get a member.
  * \return The member.
  */
  int getMember() const;
 
  private:
 
  /**
  * \brief Constructor.
  * \param member A member.
  */
  RSAKey(int member);
 
  /**
  * \brief Member.
  */
  const int m_member;
 };
 </code></pre>
 
 <p>So you can only get a pointer (well, a <em>smart</em> pointer) to a const RSAKey. To me, it makes sense, because having a non-const reference to the instance is useless (it only has const methods).</p>
 
 <p>Do you guys see any issue regarding this pattern ? Are immutable classes something common in C++ or did I just created a monster ?</p>
 
 <p>Thank you for your advices !</p>"
